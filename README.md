# Diabetes-Prediction-Neural-Network-From-Scratch
I developed a two-layer neural network from scratch to predict diabetes onset. Leveraging the Leaky ReLU and sigmoid activation functions enabled effective binary classification. Utilizing the binary cross-entropy loss function, I was able to facilitate accurate gradient calculations and enable successful implementation of backpropagation. After iteratively updated the weights and biases, I was able to achieve an 80% training accuracy rate and 78% testing accuracy rate.
